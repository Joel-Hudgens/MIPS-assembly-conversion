# MIPS Assembly Conversion
This repository is dedicated to translating C code into MIPS assembly language. I wrote 100% of the mips code from scratch, without converters, using my knowledge from an assembly language course. I try to keep the code as readable as possible, utilizing white space, indentions, labels, and comments... something that gets important in low level languages.

## Purpose
The purpose of these projects was to gain a deeper understanding of programming concepts such as loops, pointers, and recursion by exploring how they work underneath the hood in assembly language. 

### Reflection
Stepping through assembly while debugging errors in memory, registers, and stack was one of the most fun, yet challenging, things I have ever done, and I believe these challenges have made me a much better programmer. I have also gained a new appreciation for the creators of programming languages. It is hard to fathom how this entire process is automated for several machine architectures.
