# MIPS Assembly Conversion
This repository is dedicated to translating C code snippets into MIPS assembly language. While the provided C code snippets may not run directly, as they rely on input values from a caller in C or memory in MIPS, the translated MIPS assembly code is functionally equivalent to the original C code.

## Purpose
The purpose of these projects was to gain a deeper understanding of programming concepts such as loops, pointers, and recursion by exploring how they work underneath the hood in assembly language. All of the MIPS was wrote from scratch, without converters, using my knowledge from an Assembly Language course. By converting C code snippets into MIPS assembly, I was able to enhance my comprehension of low-level programming constructs and improve my overall programming skills. 


## Disclaimer
It's important to note that the C or MIPS files provided in this repository are not standalone programs and require input values from a caller in C or memory in MIPS. Additionally, the provided files are for educational purposes and should not be used against any university academic integrity policies in any way. I am not responsible for such actions.
